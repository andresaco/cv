## Motivation

As **head of the advanced analytics product** for BBVA, I work on its strategy to deliver new features that add value to end users, without neglecting the possibility of discovering new features in initiatives that involve both end users and stakeholders.

Currently **I manage a team of 16 developers** organized in a single Scrum. Although such a large team may sound complex, this responds to my constant willingness to meet the team's requests so that they can work in the best possible way.

**I consider myself a team person**, supporting my team in everything that is necessary to the best of my ability.

**All this responsibility comes after more than 10 years working as a developer in the aerospace and banking industries**, developing from near-real time software to data pipeline tools and processes. Not only the technical part is worth mentioning, but also the motivation to communicate, share knowledge and the idea of obtaining continuous feedback from users.
