## Motivation

I completed my degree in Computer Science in Madrid in 2007. My MSc. thesis was based on
the creation, from the requirements elicitation to the implementation of a system for the selection of candidatures for an
Erasmus Mundus Master managed by the Software Engineering group at UPM University.

After this, my first professional working experience took place in 2007 and found soon a motivating work
at GMV, located in Madrid. From the very beginning I started to develop software for hifly Satellite Monitoring Center,
belonging to a team of more than 80 people that lead us to be top Satellite Control Centers provider company.
Our customers are the most relevant companies in the industry such as Eutelsat, SES Astra or NBN, among others.

**Part of my working experience took place in Luxembourg**, working as a software consultant for SES Astra.
This wonderful experience allowed me to work in an international team, where a system for automating satellite control
was developed between 2009 and 2010. Nowadays this system is becoming widely adopted for other companies for automating
control tasks.

**From 2018, I joined DATIO towards initiating my career as a Big Data engineer**, leading the set up of Python-based
solutions.

Along these years, I have become a technical reference in my working teams, specially in anything related
to user experience, and development using Java and Python technologies.

**Recently, part of my work is focused on the role of Product Owner**, leading the strategy of ETL processes within 
Datio Platform aimed at preparing data for Artificial Intelligence models training.
